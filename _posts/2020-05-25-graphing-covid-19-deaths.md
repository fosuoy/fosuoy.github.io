title: "Graphing Coronavirus deaths in the UK"

The impact of Coronavirus on the UK can be seen from data gathered by the Office
of National Statistics (ONS), I've created a short set of scripts here:

[https://github.com/fosuoy/ons_total_deaths_charting](https://github.com/fosuoy/ons_total_deaths_charting)

To keep an eye on how big the effect actually is (there is more to it than just
the deaths and it will be interesting to find other statistics we can chart to
see what the impact really is / will be).

The scripts are fairly simple (bash scripts to download a bunch of spreadsheets,
some python to process and chart it) - currently it looks like this:

![total_weekly_deaths_uk_2016_2020]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/graphing_covid_19_deaths/total_deaths_2016_2020.png)

It will be interesting to keep an eye on this going forwards...
