        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>
           My name is Yousof El-Sayed, a Software Engineer currently working as 
           a DevOps consultant through my company, <b>FOSUOY LTD</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Working in Enterprise I'm familiar with Java / Springboot / various 
           tooling / container orchestration systems (Ansible/Jenkins/Kubernetes etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
           I have experience working on development teams on Java based micro-services
           as well as on ops teams building deployment pipelines / building 
           automated large-scale infrastructure for enterprise. I know enough
           testing (functional testing / Selenium in both Java and Python) to be
           useful when required.
           <br>
           <br>
           Having been involved in most areas of the Software development pipeline
           I'm suitable for DevOps type positions pulling together 
           test / development / ops teams to smooth out delivery times of large 
           software projects.
           <br>
           <br>
           Personally I find it satisfying to build internal applications to 
           automate various business processes in order to promote efficiency / 
           save costs.
           <br>
           <br>
           My main languages are Python and Java.
