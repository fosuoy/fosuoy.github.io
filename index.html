        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>
           My name is Yousof El-Sayed, a Software Engineer currently working as 
           a DevOps consultant through my company, FOSUOY LTD.
        </p>
        <p>
           Working in Enterprise I'm familiar with Java / Springboot / various 
           tooling / container orchestration systems (Jenkins/Kubernetes etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
           Personally I'm interested in / like using Python and am borderline 
           fanatical about automating the various inefficient / ugly processes 
           you can find in enterprise environments in order to promote
           efficiency / save costs.
           <br>
           At the end of the day I enjoy what I do which I think makes me quite
           good at it!
